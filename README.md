# Missile Commander
Test project based on Missile Command.

## Gameplay
Similary to Missile Command you must protect your buildings as long as you can, but in this game it's possible to gather funds to build one of two types structures:
- Missile launcher
- Money generating house

Launcher costs 20$ and is capable of shoting projectiles. House costs 10$ and generates 10$ for every survived wave. Player loses the game if all houses are lost. Launchers have a limited ammo capacity and each missile resupply has cost of 1$, so efficient shooting saves money.

## Controls
- Aim - Mouse or gamepad right stick
- Fire - Left mouse button or gamepad right trigger

## TODO
- Missile Launcher upgrades
